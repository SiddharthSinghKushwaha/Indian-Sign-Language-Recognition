# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition
Project of recognising Indian sign language using CNN and Open CV. Further improvement is needed.

Folowing are the three major steps followed to complete this project:

* Step 1: Collecting Indian Sign Language dataset from Kaggle [Click Me](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaishnaviasonawane/indian-sign-language-dataset)
* Step 2: Building CNN model (Training Time)
* Step 3: Real-Time recognition (Testing Time)


<pre>
File name for step 2: Build-CNN-Model.ipynb (Used Google Colob to do so)
    Used small dataset to trian the model.
File name for step 3: Real-time-recognition.py
</pre>

What I have done!!!</br>
1. Uploaded smaller dataset in Google drive.</br>
2. Train CNN model in google colab.</br>
3. Download the model and keep it in the folder.</br>
4. Add the path of the model in the 'Step 3' code.</br>

Hope this help you.
